(Disclaimer. Many things in this mod are unobtainable, unfinished, and are very buggy in multiplayer. Don't use this mod in multiplayer, and use a cheat mod if you want to see everything.)
Nalyd Moddd V2.0.0 is a project I'm working on in order to try out some 'C#' code. Has some items, most of them don't do anything. But as I update the mod, and learn new things, I will add new items and features, or learn that I cannot do some features. So far this mod includes:
-136 Items
-24 Npcs 
-Post Moonlord Content
-New Pillar
-1 Main Boss
-2 Minor Bosses
-1 Sudo Boss
-Custom Projectiles
-Custom Dust
-21 Tiles
