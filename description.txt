(Disclaimer. Many things in this mod are unobtainable and unfinished. Use a cheat mod if you want to see everything.)
Nalyd Moddd V2.0.0 is a project I'm working on in order to try out some 'C#' code. Has some items, most of them don't do anything. But as I update the mod, and learn new things, I will add new items and features, or learn that I cannot do some features. So far this mod includes:
-85 Items
-9 Npcs 
-2 Bosses
-8 Projectiles
-13 Tiles
-7 Music Tracks
-1 Tree Variant
