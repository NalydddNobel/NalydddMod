(Disclaimer. Many things in this mod are unobtainable, unfinished, and are very buggy in multiplayer. Don't use this mod in multiplayer, and use a cheat mod if you want to see everything.)
Nalyd Moddd V2.0.0 is a project I'm working on in order to try out some 'C#' code. Has some items, most of them don't do anything. But as I update the mod, and learn new things, I will add new items and features, or learn that I cannot do some features. So far this mod includes:
-141 Items
-24 Npcs (says 44 but worms count as 3 npcs)
-Sudo Post Moonlord Content
-Custom Projectiles
-Custom Dust
-21 Tiles
-Unfinished Music
-11 Accessories
-1 Ore type
-Custom Chest Loot
-1 Tree Variant
-Customish AI for some bosses
