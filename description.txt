Nalyd Moddd V1.1.0 is a project I'm working on in order to try out some 'C#' code. Has some items, most of them don't do anything. But as I update the mod, and learn new things, I will add new items and features, or learn that I cannot do some features. So far this mod includes:
-62 Items
-5 Npcs
-0 Bosses
-8 Projectiles
-9 Tiles
